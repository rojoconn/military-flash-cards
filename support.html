    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How do I grade my answers?</h3>
        <p>When studying, you have two options after revealing the answer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Back of Deck</strong> - You forgot or struggled with the answer. The card will be shown again soon.</li>
            <li><strong>Good to Go</strong> - You knew the answer. The card will be scheduled for later review.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How does spaced repetition work?</h3>
        <p>The app uses the FSRS algorithm to schedule reviews at optimal intervals. Cards you find difficult are shown more frequently, while cards you know well are shown less often. This maximizes retention with minimal study time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Does the app need internet?</h3>
